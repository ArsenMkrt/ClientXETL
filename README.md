# ClientXETL - ETL Use Case Challenge

ðŸš€ Purpose
This project demonstrates a small ETL use case to:

Understand coding style and problem-solving skills.
Showcase how the team works daily through a simplified project fragment.
Provide code for discussions in an interview.

ðŸ“‹ Context
This project focuses on a simplified ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow, typically used to manage large datasets. For the purpose of this challenge, the ETL process is reduced to:

Step 1: Unzip Files
Extract ClientX_Interface.zip containing POLICY.txt and RISK.txt.
Step 2: Validate Data
Ensure data quality with structural and business rule validations.
Step 3: CRUD Modeling
Load the validated data into in-memory structures (mimics tables for CRUD operations).
